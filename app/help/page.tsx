            <p>
              Zooming plays a crucial role in exploration. When you zoom in, the
              view shifts closer to the Earth&apos;s surface, reducing the area
              covered. This is ideal for exploring smaller regions, such as local
              authorities or neighborhoods. On the other hand, zooming out provides
              a broader perspective, making it suitable for viewing larger areas
              like states or entire countries. The zoom level also affects
              the type of alerts you receive when crossing borders. At a closer zoom
              level, you&apos;ll be notified when crossing district boundaries.
              Zooming out slightly will trigger alerts only when you cross state (or
              provincial) borders. At the widest zoom level, alerts are limited to
              crossing international borders. It&apos;s like viewing a place from a
              helicopter. When you zoom out, the helicopter rises up and you can
              view a bigger area.
            </p>
            <p>
              Zoom level also affects the distance the cursor moves with one arrow key
              press. If you zoom in, this distance will decrease. At maximum zoom
              in, the cursor only travels around 1 kilometer on a single arrow key
              press. At maximum zoom out, the cursor moves approximately
              500 kilometers (this distance can vary depending on the latitude of
              the place). So, if you want to navigate a large distance, zooming out
              would help you reduce the number of key presses.
            </p>

            <p>
              Press <KeyboardShortcut>Z</KeyboardShortcut> to
              hear the distance traveled by the cursor with each arrow key press

              When you select an area, you will hear an announcement about inbound navigation.
              The area of selection depends on the current zoom
              level. If you are zoomed in, only a small place like a local
              authority will be selected, but when you are zoomed out, a large
              area such as a country can be selected.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you select a place, the cursor moves to the center of the
              selected place and navigation is limited within the area. When the
              cursor reaches a boundary, you will be warned that a boundary is
              reached. You can hear information about this place by using the tab
              key to get to the information bar and using arrow keys to switch
              between information items.

            <p>
              The adjustable pointer adds an innovative twist to exploring and
              comparing distances on the map. Imagine you hold a stick in your hand.
              You can point it in whichever direction you want and adjust the
              distance it points to by moving your hand. The adjustable pointer is like
              a stick whose length can be changed. With the current location as
              the center, you can point to a place that is situated at a distance
              equal to the length of the pointer and at an angle of your choice.
              Instead of moving your hands, you can use arrow keys to adjust
              its length and angle. North is set as 0 degrees, and as you
              rotate clockwise, the angle changes. East is 90 degrees, south is
              180 degrees, and west is 270 degrees. In this way, you can explore the
              surroundings of the cursor&apos;s location.

              The Distance Finder helps you calculate road distances between two
              locations (up to 1500 km). It provides both road distance and
              estimated travel time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Press <KeyboardShortcut>Control + Shift + D</KeyboardShortcut> to
              open the distance finder panel. Use tab to focus on the text boxes
              for starting point and destination and input the places. To select a
              place, type the name of the place and press Enter. This will bring results
              based on your search. Select a place from the results and press
              enter to select it. You can select the cursor&apos;s current location
              as the starting point or destination by pressing <KeyboardShortcut>Alt + L</KeyboardShortcut>. 
              Use the tab key to focus on the "find distance" button and press enter to announce
              the distance and time. The screen reader will announce the total road
              distance between the two points and the estimated travel time.
